*M+D looked at [a different listing](http://www.vermontproperty.com/detail/Vermont/lake-champlain-rentals/1803/) of this house last week and were concerned about road placement. The owner says that the house is 50 feet from the lake with a small dirt road in between (you can kind of see it in the pic). It's literally the bottom tip of the island so hardly anybody ever drives on this road.*
