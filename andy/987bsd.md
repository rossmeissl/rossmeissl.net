# 987 Bay Shore Drive

*This little piece of writing ended up turning out as a snark, more or less. I think the opportunity to make a few poor jokes is honestly all that's holding me back from a full-blown tirade.*
{.aside}

I understand that the conversation about selling The House Formerly Known as 987 Bay Shore Drive has graduated from speculation to likelihood. This is upsetting for several reasons, many of which I will get into below, but even before that I am faced with a nagging question:

***What the hell is Grandma going to do with all that money?***

After all, the house is currently on Judy's balance sheet, not the estate's. Thanks to several goddamn Democratic presidents, there's not a ton of room for fiddling with the transfer of large amounts of wealth. I can nevertheless think of several plausible reasons why she would want so much money.

### Reasons to want crazy cash stacks

1. Replace uncomfortable Hearthside bed with new custom-sewn mattress stuffed with hundred dollar bills.

1. Purchase a large, beautiful waterfront house, laden with amenities (you should see the sunsets!) within which her numerous daughters and their families could come together every year to celebrate the holidays and each other.

1. In defiance of tax codes everywhere, hide $500,000 cash in each daughter's napkin during Christmas dinner.

So . . . let's agree that Grandma probably neither needs nor wants a gazillion dollars, in cash, immediately. Might there be other reasons to sell the house? I can think of a couple.

### Other reasons to sell the house immediately

1. Relieve herself of the carrying costs associated with keeping the house.

1. Make modest tax-code-compliant annual gifts to each daughter to help subsidize their incomes.

The first reason is certainly based on sound economic thinking. Perhaps the cost (taxes, upkeep) of the house outweighs the benefits (say, the yearly Christmas reunion, at a minimum). But if we're going to think economically about this decision, let's **go all the way** and  take a moment to acquaint ourselves with the following graph:

![Housing prices](http://cr4re.com/charts/chart-images/RealHousePricesFeb2011Prelim.jpg)

To put some (rough) numbers around this, if we sell the house now, at 70% of its hypothetical peak price, we're leaving, say, *$600,000 on the table*. It would take *over a decade* of avoided property tax payments to make up for that lost income.

In other words, the opportunity cost of selling the house now far outweighs the carrying cost of keeping it.

As for the second reason: that's a fair thing to want to do. Times are tough, everybody could use a little help making ends meet. Sure would be great if there were a way to leverage a capital asset to derive ongoing annuity payments . . . oh, wait! *There is!*

**It's called rent** and we should start charging it. That house sits empty 50 weeks a year. By my naive calculations made this spring, Grandma could be clearing over $65,000 a year in rent from her asset, more than enough to make her maximum-allowed-by-law gift payments.

In summary, so far, I feel like "selling the house" is a **solution looking for a problem**. Nobody in this equation needs a boatload of cash, all at one time, *right now,* even if the tax code were to allow it. We'd be making a good move if everybody involved could candidly discuss what the actual, real problems at hand are.

The more I think about this, the more I wonder how we even got here. This whole conversation is really quite absurd. I mean, we've heard the story a million times: a great man, a one-in-a-million man, survives the Great Depression and emerges, through back-breaking work, megaliters of sweat, and grim determination, with a modest fortune with which to care for his family. His children then, after his passing, squander said fortune.

Do we really want to be a clich√© we read about in *Us Weekly*? Isn't there a less reckless form of dark ironic comedy we could consider? Are we so awash in shortsightedness that we'd really, really *cash in a house* for chrissakes? How would Grandpa feel about his great-great-grandchildren being bamboozled out of the primary material product of his life by his own kids? Can we really not live up to his standard? Are we really going to fail this first real test?

**The house is an heirloom.** It should be treated that way. You sell an heirloom to buy a farm, or to escape the Nazis, not to bolster your monthly cash flow.

We can do better than this.
